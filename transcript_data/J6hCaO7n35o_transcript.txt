this is the Apple Watch series 9 and if you're in the market for a smartwatch it's hard to find anything that comes close to this model I bought the series 9 as soon as it was announced in September and I've been using it ever since this past week I've also been wearing the Google pixel Watch 2 quite a bit and previously I used the Series 6 for a few years so that's given me somewhat of a unique perspective on what makes this watch great without just comparing it to last year's version today I want to get into what not only makes the series 9 a fantastic device but also some areas where it could improve and just in general why the Apple watch is the king when it comes to smart watches so if you're looking to move over to an Apple Watch or maybe you're considering upgrading the one you have stick around and let's get into [Music] it hey everyone Kyle Erikson here the Apple Watch series 9 came out exactly 1 month ago and this was the first real watch that I felt like I could justify moving up from my series 64 the previous couple years had seen relatively small upgrades in performance with essentially the same rebranded chipset but this this year that was finally upgraded and combined with the slow depth of my Series 6 battery gave me the perfect excuse to pick one up the model that I have here today is the 45mm version It's Starlight in color and has the Nike sport Loop watch band I wanted Starlite and this band in particular because I felt like it paired really well with my natural titanium iPhone 15 Pro and with a new Nike Globe watch face I think it looks great the time I'll wear my watch in the shower or submerge it in water so I was a little concerned with a band getting wet but it actually dries quite fast and I was curious about the strap being like a velcro material sometimes with velcro you can get a buildup of worn out material or pilling and it doesn't work as well when that happens but so far so good on that front what I like about this style of strap is it is a lot more comfortable than the rubber or leather ones and it's super easy to adjust say if I'm out on a run and I want to tighten it up outside of that it's pretty much the same design as it's always been which I think as watch OS gets more advanced seems to make more and more sense like I said earlier I've been using the pixel Watch 2 for the past week or so and I think the design of that watch is fine it's light comfortable it looks decent but I don't know something about round screen just feels wrong I don't know that anyone has really figured out round screens on watches yet it just feels like something is always getting cut off or it doesn't look quite right and when we're used to seeing everything on a rectangular screen it just feels like it's trying to force a square peg through a round hole just speaking of screens the series 9 still has the same thin bezels as the previous couple Generations but it got a big update this year doubling the brightness to 2,000 nits and on the flip side being able to go all the way down to one nit I was really excited about this update because previously if I was in direct sunlight looking at my watch face it wasn't always clear which is the same issue that I have on most watches but this definitely gets brighter and is a lot more visible in those scenarios it's also a little bit brighter if you're using it as a flashlight too which can be quite handy at times as far as the display being able to go down to one knit was previously able to drop down to about two which might not seem like a big deal but but in cases like powering the always on display at night it will conserve a little more battery life in regards to the battery Apple says that the series 9 will give you 18 hours of battery life or 36 I believe in low power mode and this is one area where apple is usually pretty conservative in their estimates in real world use I get just over 30 hours battery life with regular usage including sleeping with it and about a 45 minute workout mixed in there without low power mode on just keep in mind I'm not using it to play music or take calls or anything like that usually which will d it a lot faster also because it does last well over a day I'd prefer if it had the same 80% charge limit that the iPhone 15 has right now you can toggle optimize charging from the battery health settings but I find it generally always charges to 100% probably because I don't charge overnight or anything and if Apple were to limit that to 80% I likely wouldn't even notice and it would extend my battery health over a longer time span that battery poers the all new S9 chip that has a 30% faster GPU and two times faster neural engine which looking at those specs don't really make a huge difference navigating around on your Apple watch you're not going to notice any difference with normal operation but it does enable some new features on the software side of things the improved neural engine enables a lot more functionality to sit on the watch itself like an offline Siri and the new double tap feature as far as Siri goes you can now do very basic things like setting timers or asking health questions without an internet connection or without it having hit the cloud first and come back with an answer even when you do just run a standard query with Siri that sounds so stupid stupid it seems faster and the actual dictation is much more accurate and reliable and as a whole Siri just feels like it's improved a bit on the Apple watch when it comes to the double tap feature depending on when you watch this that may not be available in a public release yet outside of the beta versions but that is coming very soon I've just installed the beta for now just to get a sense for how well this works and I do find it quite helpful at times I can use that to cycle through my widgets pause and play tracks answer and hangup calls or application specific stuff like taking a photo some people are brought up that this already exists on the Apple watch in the form of assist of touch where if you navigate through your settings under accessibility you can enable custom gestures and while it does appear to be similar on the surface the way it works is actually quite different Beyond double tapping enabled by default unlike assist of touch it works by using the neural engine with a completely new algorithm on the S9 chip where assist of touch uses a CPU a double tap uses less battery than assist of touch and is much more accurate as well where assist of touch could be hit or miss at times double taps seems to work every time and the only catch is that you can't just double tap with your hand at your side you have to physically raise your watch up and pinch I found this to be really useful for one-handed use say if you're busy doing something and you don't have to handsfree and you need to pause something or answer a call there's some customization available in terms of how it handles music or if it will scroll through widgets in the smart stack which is new with watch OS 10 and I'll touch on in a minute but overall having that added functionality can be extremely useful so the S9 enables all that but it's not the only new Hardware in here there's a new Ultra wideband chip in the series 9 any Ultra 2 watches that enables Precision finding and that works with the new iPhone lineup from this here where if I go into my Control Center and click the little phone icon there it will tell me where my phone is similar to how air tags work the big difference here is there's a much longer range than previous Precision finding devices this will read up to about 100 ft away and if you're someone like me who misplaces your stuff a lot this is bound to get used from time to time this along with most of the features that I've been talking about will only be coming to the series 9 and Ultra 2 watches because of the new hardware but watch 10 should be available for everyone with the series 4 watch and later I think that's really the biggest thing that I noticed on my watch this year I did a video going over watch OS 10 a while back just because it is quite a departure from the previous version I'll just link that video in the description rather than diving into every aspect of it but everything feels and looks so much better on watch us 10 over previous versions you have the new smart stack which is basically just a stack of widgets that you can customize that give you nice visual look at something at a glance there's a lot of blurred translucent background similar to iOS and fulls screen views like in the fitness app where there's a lot more information present the maps app has been updated with actual viewable maps and if you live in the US those have topology and in general it feels like the watch relies Less on my phone which is something that I noticed I was probably taking for granted after using the pixel Watch 2 don't get me wrong the pixel watch does a good job at offering similar functionality in a lot of ways but the amount of times it tells me to open up my phone to continue to do something is far greater than on the Apple watch and while I think that weos and the devices that work with it are getting better every year there's just nothing that compares to watch OS in my opinion watchos looks great it's easy to navigate around and there's multiple ways that I can reply to messages or view content and every year seems to become a little more independent or less reliant on my phone one area where I think the pixel watch does compete and maybe even bests the Apple watch this year in some aspects is with fitness and health I think it's quite proficient with a lot of that stuff with Google integrating Fitbit so much into the watch I find sleep tracking to be very similar between these watches but I might give a slight Edge to the pixel Watch 2 here I find it logs the times that I wake up a little bit better and I obviously have no way of knowing how accurate either of these are with sleep cycles but the difference is probably trivial nonetheless they both log workouts just fine and give similar results the series 9 has improved heart rate tracking over last year's model as does the pixel Watch 2 there's supposed to be improved GPS accuracy in the series 9 as well but honestly that's not something that I ever personally use if you live or work in a large city and you have a lot of tall buildings around you and maybe you're trying to log your runs or something that might be of value to you but if you're just an open space you're probably not going to notice a huge difference from previous years and frankly I just think that in terms of generally using the watch the series 9 isn't going to feel all that different from the last couple of generations those are all going to get watch OS 10 so unless you really want some of the new features like double tap or offline Siri or if you're like I was and your battery is toast it might be worth hanging on to what you have I do want to mention I notice a lot of people struggling with battery life that have upgraded to watch OS 10 from older models when I updated the series 9 to the beta version I saw a fix listed for battery life when I was reading release notes so if that is affecting you just keep a look out for updates and update when you can and hopefully that will alleviate some of those issues that being said given the Alternatives that currently exist I still think that the Apple watch has the most to offer out of any Smartwatch whether you're using the series 9 and Ultra SE or older versions I am actually quite curious to know how many of you maybe don't have an Apple Watch and are considering getting one for the first time who's considering upgrading and who's continuing to hold on to the same model you have now so please drop a comment down below and let me know that's it for me today I hope you found this video useful or entertaining if you did feel free to hit that like button if you want to see more Tech related content or help create the Catalina wine mixer
