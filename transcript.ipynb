It is quite tricky to capture on camera, but here you can see it for yourself under a bunch of different circumstances. Second, one of the main things that was addressed in the keynote is that it has a new and much more powerful S9 chip, which among other things enables the “double tap”. This was one of the most highlighted features during the keynote, maybe a bit too much in my opinion, but it is quite cool. This is available starting from watchOS version 10.1, which unfortunately isn’t out yet, and Apple did not invite me to the launch event or give me early access, so I couldn’ test it. Hey Apple, hint, hint… Now, online I saw many comments that Apple Watches basically had this feature for a long time, called Assistive Touch. I tried Assistive Touch on my Apple Watch Series 8 before the Series 9 was released, and it does have much of the same functionalities as Double Tap. Though I did find it kind of clunky to use. DC Rainmaker mentioned in his video that the double tap feature worked significantly better for him than Assistive touch. Now, Apple says the double tap feature will only work on the Series 9, because it needs the S9 chip, which is probably true for the way it is implemented. However, I still wonder if they couldn’t have made it work on older series if they’d really wanted to, but OK, it is Apple we are talking about. Now, the new S9 chip also enables Siri to do some new things: first of all, Siri can now process some commands on-device, meaning it is much faster at doing certain things, like setting an alarm. This is honestly much more important to me than double tap, since I will use Siri much more for these kinds of small tasks now. Siri can now also access your health and fitness data, and also add health data via voice commands, or at least, you will be able to do so “later this year”.', 'thumbnails': {'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'standard': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/sddefault.jpg', 'width': 640, 'height': 480}, 'maxres': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/maxresdefault.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}}, 'channelTitle': 'The Quantified Scientist', 'tags': ['apple watch ultra 2 vs series 9', 'apple watch series 9 vs ultra 2', 'ultra 2 vs series 9', 'apple watch ultra vs series 9', 'series 9 vs ultra 2', 'ultra 2', 'series 9', 'apple watch', 'apple watch ultra 2', 'apple watch series 9', 'apple watch comparison', 'apple', 'ultra 2 review', 'series 9 review', 'ultra 2 vs series 9 comparison', 'series 9 vs ultra 2 comparison', 'apple watch ultra 2 vs 1', 'apple watch ultra', 'series 9 vs ultra', 'ultra 1 vs ultra 2', 'ultra 2 vs ultra 1', 'series 9 vs series 8', 'watch'], 'categoryId': '28', 'liveBroadcastContent': 'none', 'localized': {'title': 'Apple Watch Series 9 : Full SCIENTIFIC Review', 'description': '🔴 Get a Series 9!*: https://geni.us/AppleWatch_Series9\\n🔴 Get an Apple Watch Ultra2*: https://geni.us/AppleWatch_Ultra2\\n🔴 General Amazon link*: https://geni.us/thequantifiedscientist\\n🟢 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/quantified_scientist/\\n🟠 Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@smartwatchshorts\\n🔵 Newsletter: www.robterhorst.com\\n🟡 Twitter: @QuantifiedRob\\n* Affiliate (paid) links support the channel by earning me a commission on any sale, and it doesn\\'t cost you any more!

It is quite tricky to capture on camera, but here you can see it for yourself under a bunch of different circumstances. Second, one of the main things that was addressed in the keynote is that it has a new and much more powerful S9 chip, which among other things enables the “double tap”. This was one of the most highlighted features during the keynote, maybe a bit too much in my opinion, but it is quite cool. This is available starting from watchOS version 10.1, which unfortunately isn’t out yet, and Apple did not invite me to the launch event or give me early access, so I couldn’ test it. Hey Apple, hint, hint… Now, online I saw many comments that Apple Watches basically had this feature for a long time, called Assistive Touch. I tried Assistive Touch on my Apple Watch Series 8 before the Series 9 was released, and it does have much of the same functionalities as Double Tap. Though I did find it kind of clunky to use. DC Rainmaker mentioned in his video that the double tap feature worked significantly better for him than Assistive touch. Now, Apple says the double tap feature will only work on the Series 9, because it needs the S9 chip, which is probably true for the way it is implemented. However, I still wonder if they couldn’t have made it work on older series if they’d really wanted to, but OK, it is Apple we are talking about. Now, the new S9 chip also enables Siri to do some new things: first of all, Siri can now process some commands on-device, meaning it is much faster at doing certain things, like setting an alarm. This is honestly much more important to me than double tap, since I will use Siri much more for these kinds of small tasks now. Siri can now also access your health and fitness data, and also add health data via voice commands, or at least, you will be able to do so “later this year”.', 'thumbnails': {'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'standard': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/sddefault.jpg', 'width': 640, 'height': 480}, 'maxres': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4igZ3DEhrk4/maxresdefault.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}}, 'channelTitle': 'The Quantified Scientist', 'tags': ['apple watch ultra 2 vs series 9', 'apple watch series 9 vs ultra 2', 'ultra 2 vs series 9', 'apple watch ultra vs series 9', 'series 9 vs ultra 2', 'ultra 2', 'series 9', 'apple watch', 'apple watch ultra 2', 'apple watch series 9', 'apple watch comparison', 'apple', 'ultra 2 review', 'series 9 review', 'ultra 2 vs series 9 comparison', 'series 9 vs ultra 2 comparison', 'apple watch ultra 2 vs 1', 'apple watch ultra', 'series 9 vs ultra', 'ultra 1 vs ultra 2', 'ultra 2 vs ultra 1', 'series 9 vs series 8', 'watch'], 'categoryId': '28', 'liveBroadcastContent': 'none', 'localized': {'title': 'Apple Watch Series 9 : Full SCIENTIFIC Review', 'description': '🔴 Get a Series 9!*: https://geni.us/AppleWatch_Series9\\n🔴 Get an Apple Watch Ultra2*: https://geni.us/AppleWatch_Ultra2\\n🔴 General Amazon link*: https://geni.us/thequantifiedscientist\\n🟢 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/quantified_scientist/\\n🟠 Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@smartwatchshorts\\n🔵 Newsletter: www.robterhorst.com\\n🟡 Twitter: @QuantifiedRob\\n* Affiliate (paid) links support the channel by earning me a commission on any sale, and it doesn\\'t cost you any more!
